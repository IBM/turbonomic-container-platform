# Turbonomic Container Platform

A helm repo and store of yaml files required for customer initiated deployment of Turbonomic agents kubeturbo prometurbo in customer owned container platform clusters

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add turbo-charts https://ibm.github.io/turbonomic-container-platform/

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  
You can then run `helm search repo turbo-charts` to see the charts.

To install the kubeturbo chart:

    helm install my-kubeturbo turbo-charts/kubeturbo

To uninstall the chart:

    helm delete my-kubeturbo
